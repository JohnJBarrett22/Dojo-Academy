Injection is a very common form of online attack where any source of data can be utilized as a vector to send hostile data.
Applications vulnerable to attack are more common with SQL, NoSQL, OS command, ORM, LDAP, EL or OGNL...though any type of input is vulnerable.
With this knowledge in mind, it must be assumed that all data coming in is hostile and act accordingly with proper validation, filtration and sanitization of the input.
Additionally, keeping data separate from commands and queries will help minimize risk, though there are several additional steps you can take depending on software stack being used to minimze exposure.

The largest known injection attack amassed a total of 1.2 billion passwords from more than 420,000 websites using a simple SQL injection.
An e-crime ring in Russia was able to pull off this feat in early 2013.
Though injection is still common today, there has yet to be a breach quite as large.
