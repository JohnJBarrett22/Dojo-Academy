Cross-site scripting is another prevelent form of attack that catches many unsuspecting users by suprise.
Automated tools can easily detect XSS opportunities with older techncologies, such as PHP, J2EE/JSP and ASP.NET where malicious JS code can be uploaded.
Once uploaded, these scripts would essentially run depending on the set up and vector, to retrieve information from the victim viewing the site and send it back to the attacker.
The three major forms of cross-site scripting are reflected, stored and DOM XSS.
These attacks can be prevented however, by using newer technologies and techniques such as escaping, filtering and validating.

Dating back to 2017, eBay was still be actively hit with malicious scripts that plagued the the site years beforehand.
Fraudsters took advantage of the vulnerabilities within eBay's site to steal account credentials and then use those stolen accounts to modify their listings with malicious code.
When an unsuspecting user viewed the listing, they would be "kicked out" of the site and sent to a spoofed login page, where their credentials would then be stolen if they attempted to sign back in.
Since victims are unlikely to expect a phising attack from within eBay's search results, the efficacy of these attacks are far greater than your average phishing scam.
