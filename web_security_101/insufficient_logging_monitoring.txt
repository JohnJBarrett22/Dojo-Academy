Exploitation of insufficient logging and monitoring is the bedrock of nearly every major incident and is something that should not be overlooked.
Most successful attacks start with vulnerability probing; allowing such probes to continue can raise the likelihood of successful exploit to nearly 100%.
Applications are vulnerable if there is insufficient logging, detection, monitoring or active response.
Additionally, even if you did log the events, if your architecture is not set up correctly, you could be providing these logs to the very attacker your are trying to monitor.
In order to prevent this vector, ensure all login, access control and server-side input can be logged/monitored in real time sufficiently.
Furthermore, having plans in place on how to handle an incident can be paramont in minimizing risk and exposure.

Just a few months ago, Morgan Stanley was required to pay a $14M fine due to insufficient fraud monitoring.
This fine stems from allegations that for more than five years its anti-money laundering program failed to appropiately monitor tens of billions of dollars in transactions that ran through brokerage accounts.
While this may not have been done online, the software systems in place should have been set to monitor these processes to prevent such activity.
