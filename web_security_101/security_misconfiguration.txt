Security misconfirguartion is one of the most common ways for attackers to exploit or access an application/system.
Unpatched flaws, default account access, unused pages, unprotected files/directories and other sources are all vectors that can give an attacker unauthorized access.
Such flaws, could result in a complete system compromise.
An easy way to prevent such attacks is ensuring that all environments are properly locked down and that the platform is minimalistic, free of unnecessary features, components, documentation or samples.
Removing or avoiding installing bloat by means of unsused features or frameworks goes a long way!

Just two years ago, Accenture, a leader in cloud technology inadvertently left four AWS S3 buckets open to the public.
This laspe in security and awareness made all the contents in those buckets, available to anybody for download.
Of the four buckets, the largest contained more than 137 gigabytes of data including credentials to datebases and over 40,000 plain word passwords, some belonging to Accenture customers.
This is just one of many companies that have exposed client or sensitive data by improperly configuring the security settings, or failing to do so at all.
