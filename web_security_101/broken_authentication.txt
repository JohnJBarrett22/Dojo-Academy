Broken authentication ranks in at #2 on OWASP's list of top vulnerabilities.
Due to the design and implementation of most identity and access controls, the prevalence of broken authentication is widespread.
Attack vectors include attempts to penetrate the system through credential stuffing, default administrative accounts not being secured, automated brute force and dictionary attack tools.\
Once access is obtained to only a few accounts or possibly just one admin account, the entire system may be comprimised.
The easiest and most successful counter to this to use multi-factor authentication.
Additionally, do not ship/deploy any default credentials, include password strength level checks, limit failed login attempts and ensure proper session management.

I can not currently find any article of a real world example of broken authentication or poor session management.
I will continue to research examples while I progress through the other modules.
